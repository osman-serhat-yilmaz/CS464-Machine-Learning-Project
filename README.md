# CS464-Machine-Learning-Project
 Project for for the course CS464 Introduction to Machine Learning 

This term project aims to implement machine learning algorithms that can classify the
letters of American Sign Language (ASL). As the first step of the project the “Sign
Language (ENG Alphabet)” dataset on Kaggle has been chosen and examined. Feature
extraction is performed on the images in the dataset for dimensionality reduction to
decrease the sizes of images in order to achieve ease of computation. After
preprocessing the images they were converted to arrays that consist their grayscale
pixel information. Having preprocessed the dataset, machine learning classification
models such as k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were
used for supervised learning. A deep learning algorithm which is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used in the
following stage of the project
